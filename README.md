## About

This project connects to a database and gives the user a menu option to search the data base for films and actors. The user can search using the film or actors id, or a keyword that the film title or description could contain.

## What I learned

I learned that using prepared sql statements can help prevent sql injections. I furthered my knowledge of interface classes and object classes uses, realizing that I could use one interface to call multiple classes that access different databases. This program however only accesses one database, but the interface could be used to access more. I have also furthered my knowledge of creating my own toString to make the read out more user friendly.
